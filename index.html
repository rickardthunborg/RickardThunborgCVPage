            <img src="bradpitt.jpg" alt="bradpitt">
            <p>My name is Bradette Pitt. I am an actress from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like every other actor. <br>
            <br>
            I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known for playing charismatic female leads, and have been described as the world's most beautiful woman by several media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play motherly figures, which I am to my six children. <br>
            <br>
            Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company Plan B Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of these interestsâ€”sometimes all three!
